To run R code:

Download and unzip hiC_data.zip from the /data directory, store files in a new directory called /HiC_bezier
Download hiC_bezier_curves_plot.r from the /r directory and store in directory /HiC_bezier
Download testHiC.sh from this directory and store in directory /HiC_bezier
NOTE: All data files, .r and .sh scripts must be in the same directory (/HiC_bezier)

Run testHiC.sh from the command line

Plot will be written to a PNG file in the /HiC_bezier directory
