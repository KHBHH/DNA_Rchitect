Download hiC_bezier_curves_plot.r from the /r directory and store in directory /HiC_bezier
NOTE: All data files, .r and .sh scripts must be in the same directory (/HiC_bezier)

Run the following line in command terminal:
Rscript hiC_bezier_curves_plot.r H3k_Fox_Hichip_matrix.txt chr1 60853778 60948071 H3K27Ac FoxP3 blue red Gencode.chr1.txt

Plot will be written to a PNG file in the /HiC_bezier directory
