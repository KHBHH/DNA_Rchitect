### Introduction
[Shiny Apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) are interactive web applications built with R using the `shiny` R package. Shiny apps are built with R wrappers for HTML, CSS, and JS to run R code in a web browser through a dynamic and reactive user interface that is powered by an underlying NodeJS engine. These apps can be locally hosted from a R session or hosted in the cloud through a [ShinyServer](http://www.shinyapps.io/).

### File format requirements
Files must have standard headers.

### Tutorial
There is an interactive tutorial accessible through the help button on the app.
